# ESP-IDF

Welcome to my ESP-IDF repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and components that I have created while learning to program ESP32 microcontrollers using the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework).

## Introduction

This repository documents my journey of learning ESP32 programming using the ESP-IDF framework. Each project represents a step in my learning process, from basic concepts to more advanced topics. The projects are designed to be educational and practical, providing examples that can be used as a reference for others who are also learning ESP-IDF.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. **blinky**: A simple "Hello World" project that blinks an LED on the ESP32
2. **dht11_with_components**:  A DHT11 component for measuring temperature and humidity.
3. **hc_sr04_with_components**: A HC_SR04 component for messuring distance.
...

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to set up the ESP-IDF development environment on your machine. Follow the instructions below to install the necessary tools and dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **ESP-IDF**: The Espressif IoT Development Framework.
- **ESP32 Toolchain**: The toolchain for compiling and flashing ESP32 firmware.
- **Python**: Required for some ESP-IDF tools.
- **Visual Studio Code and ESP-IDF Extension**: This is optional.  However, it will make programming, compiling and flashing ESP32 firmware tasks much easier for people who do not want to remember all the tool chain commands.
- **Git**: For cloning this repository.

- You will need an ESP32 microcontrollor and some IoT components (such as LEDs, DHT11, HC-SR04, etc.). You can purchase these from AliExpress, Temu or Amazon.
- I also recommend you purchase a JTAG to help with debugging.


### Installation

1. **Install ESP-IDF and optionally Visual Studio Code ESP-IDF Extension **:
   Follow the official [ESP-IDF Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to install the ESP-IDF framework.

2. **Clone this repository**:
